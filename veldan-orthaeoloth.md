## Backstory

Was thinking a Drow who found some forbidden abhorration in the underdark. He spent time as an archeologist, and found a genie bottle. Since the genie couldn't grant his wish to know everything about the creature, it became his patron. I can change some or all of this if you have ideas for joint characters with the accents

So just spit spitballing, what if he found an artifact that pulled an alter ego of himself that exists on another plane or alternate universe. Only to realize that the alter ego isn't so alter lol. Part of the quest can be to search for the other half or fragment of the artifact

### Journal

#### 12th Virgo, 1133th Shadowfall

*Noontide*

I have been chosen to accompany **Ilareth Dilynrae Hune** on her expedition to **Harl'kyorlin** *(under waiting)*. It is certain that my skill will be most useful to her. I am, after all, one of the more highly trained experts on the Abyss, even speaking their gutteral tongue, the learning of which is no small feat. This is the chance that I've been waiting for. Finally, I will prove myself essential to the **Malla Akh'noamuth** *(honoured group of wanderers)*, and be accepted into the senior ranks. It it surly mere months until I lead my own expeditions into the far reaches of the underdark. I wonder what mysteries I will uncover, what discoveries they will name after me?

It is all finally happening.

#### 19th Virgo, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

All is prepared! Today is the day. I have packed fully, forgetting nothing. Today my new life begins. Today I make my house proud.

Addendum: *Eve*

It is the eve of the first day.

I hardly know where to begin. I lie hunkered over this paper, barely able to hear myself think as two others fill this tiny tent with their snoring. These cramped conditions are the least of what I must endure. It turns out that I was not brought along for my expertise. **Guldor Tuin** - **Ilareth Dilynrae's** absolutely brainless second in command - didn't even know that I speak Abyssal, nor did he think it important enough to mention to his boss. I am, as he put it, a "glorified pack mule and shovel".

Eveything aches. I can hardly keep my eyes open to put pen to parchment from the forced march carrying, I am certain, a weight approaching my own in equipment. My position when we arrive will not be that of scribe, of one who labels and sorts the finding, but effectively of a **ryld** (*slave*), digging and brushing, carrying and carting.

Why me?

#### 24th Virgo, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

This trek is endless. Each day is longer than the last. We voyage further and further down the winding **Colbautharl** (underpath); further in directions I've never delved. My meager hours of rest are spent sketching vague maps of what I can remember before sinking into a trance deeper than I thought possible. It must end soon.

#### 4th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

We left the **Colbautharl** days ago, treking down paths rarely trod. The road has not been easy. More than one of our party has stumbled over an unseen rock or outcropping. I am not among those. Through this humiliation I have held my head high... or as high as I can under the load they have provided for me. **Ilareth Dilynrae** Informed the party that tomorrow we will reach the entrance to **Harl'kyorlin** that she has chosen to attempt. It is an unusual choice in my opinion. The standard entrace which has been at least partly mapped lies miles away to the south. This wesy-nor-western entrance is but newly discovered, and surely contains many more dangers than the more well trodden paths. Regardless of the choice, I've been informed that I will at least be in the first party entering, if only to remove rubble that needs clearing.

**Ilareth Dilynrae**, and her chosen Magus **Nyloth Zauviir** will be sweeping for any magical remnants. Certainly others who have attempted **Harl'kyorlin** have found explosive runes... and worse among the ancient stones. Well, that or have found the remains of those who found the runes. I am certainly not interested in being the first to discover one of those.

#### 5th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

The first death.

One of the other... *pack mules*. I didn't know his name. He was large and strong, excessively so. Probably why he was chosen. I saw it happen.

We entered the ruin through the shattered wall of an ancient hallway, what purpose the hallway served, we don't yet know. The northern direction had been fully caved in, so we turned to the south-south-eastern direction. It took perhaps three hours to get to the first archway, moving slowly and carefully, clearing the rubble as we went. The archway itself was large, fully twice the size of one of our standard ones; intricately decorated with a series of pictographs and runes in a language I do not yet understand. It opened into a large domed room, surprisingly mostly intact. Several exits aside from the one we entered were visible, as well as a few pillars which were covered, as the archway, in pictographs and runes. The floor was an intricate picture that once must have been glorious to behold. Now cracked and covered with rock and dust. **Ilareth Dilynrae** was satisfied that this would be a good place to begin the mapping of the ruins. She and **Magus Zauviir** went through the room for over an hour as we waited, finding nothing. We began clearing rubble.

It turns out that not all the dangers here are magical.

The large *mule* was requested to move a particularly large piece of rock. He hefted it with some difficulty. It must have weighed at least four or five of me. It turns out that there was a weight-triggered pressure plate that had been rusted. No other had managed to trigger it. The combined weight must have done it.

Four floor tiles shattered as their mechanisms failed. Two of the four spears did not fail. They were long and thick, matching the relative size of these ruins. I suppose they would be meant to hold, or at least gravely injure a creature perhaps two and a half times the size of their victim. Instead, his head turned fully to mush, and the left half of his body was ripped fully off. I have never seen anything like that. I must write about this. I must get these images down on paper, so that perhaps for but a moment they will leave my mind...

#### 9th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

We've delved deeper and further into the ruins. Perhaps a few thousand feet or so down one of the passages off of the room which has officially been named the Map Room, but I prefer to think of as the Prima Mortis -- the First Death. There are official cartographers of course, but I keep my own maps as well. Perhaps they will have value one day.

This place is intricate, winding. Halls off of halls off of halls are punctuated occasionally by huge rooms, some intact, some filled with rubble. I find myself ignoring the delicate carvings, ornate statues, and impressive craftsmanship to focus more on what the floor beneath me feels like, are there hidden tripwires, holes in the walls for spears or darts.

It turns out there are those among us with keen senses however, and they've quickly been put to work aiding **Ilareth Dilynrae** and the Magus in sweeping rooms and corridors.

Many more traps have been found and disarmed. I'm exhausted from being in a constant state of heightened awareness. One only can speculate on what the morrow may bring.

#### 13th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

My first day of rest since arriving here. **Ilareth Dilynrae** and **Magus Zauviir** have ordered no futher progress while they investigate the last room that we found, but I will get to that.

The last days have been taxing to the extreme. I find myself at the limits of my physical capabilities. Everything aches more than I thought possible; I feel muscles I didn't know I had. More than that is the numbing of intellect. I find myself falling into an intellectual rut, having had no time to engage in anything other than brute physical mindlessness. We haven't even started dusting and catagorizing artifacts. It's just been moving of rubble and rocks, clearing and cleaning, acting as janitors for a long dead city.

We are, at least, making progress.
