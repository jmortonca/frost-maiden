### Journal: Harl'kyorli

#### 12th Virgo, 1133th Shadowfall

*Noontide*

I have been chosen to accompany **Ilareth Dilynrae Hune** on her expedition to **Harl'kyorlin** *(under waiting)*. It is certain that my skill will be most useful to her. I am, after all, one of the more highly trained experts on the Abyss, even speaking their gutteral tongue, the learning of which is no small feat. This is the chance that I've been waiting for. Finally, I will prove myself essential to the **Malla Akh'noamuth** *(honoured group of wanderers)*, and be accepted into the senior ranks. It it surly mere months until I lead my own expeditions into the far reaches of the underdark. I wonder what mysteries I will uncover, what discoveries they will name after me?

It is all finally happening.

#### 19th Virgo, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

All is prepared! Today is the day. I have packed fully, forgetting nothing. Today my new life begins. Today I make my house proud.

Addendum: *Eve*

It is the eve of the first day.

I hardly know where to begin. I lie hunkered over this paper, barely able to hear myself think as two others fill this tiny tent with their snoring. These cramped conditions are the least of what I must endure. It turns out that I was not brought along for my expertise. **Guldor Tuin** - **Ilareth Dilynrae's** absolutely brainless second in command - didn't even know that I speak Abyssal, nor did he think it important enough to mention to his boss. I am, as he put it, a "glorified pack mule and shovel".

Eveything aches. I can hardly keep my eyes open to put pen to parchment from the forced march carrying, I am certain, a weight approaching my own in equipment. My position when we arrive will not be that of scribe, of one who labels and sorts the finding, but effectively of a **ryld** (*slave*), digging and brushing, carrying and carting.

Why me?

#### 24th Virgo, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

This trek is endless. Each day is longer than the last. We voyage further and further down the winding **Colbautharl** (underpath); further in directions I've never delved. My meager hours of rest are spent sketching vague maps of what I can remember before sinking into a trance deeper than I thought possible. It must end soon.

#### 4th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

We left the **Colbautharl** days ago, treking down paths rarely trod. The road has not been easy. More than one of our party has stumbled over an unseen rock or outcropping. I am not among those. Through this humiliation I have held my head high... or as high as I can under the load they have provided for me. **Ilareth Dilynrae** Informed the party that tomorrow we will reach the entrance to **Harl'kyorlin** that she has chosen to attempt. It is an unusual choice in my opinion. The standard entrace which has been at least partly mapped lies miles away to the south. This wesy-nor-western entrance is but newly discovered, and surely contains many more dangers than the more well trodden paths. Regardless of the choice, I've been informed that I will at least be in the first party entering, if only to remove rubble that needs clearing.

**Ilareth Dilynrae**, and her chosen Magus **Nyloth Zauviir** will be sweeping for any magical remnants. Certainly others who have attempted **Harl'kyorlin** have found explosive runes... and worse among the ancient stones. Well, that or have found the remains of those who found the runes. I am certainly not interested in being the first to discover one of those.

#### 5th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

The first death.

One of the other... *pack mules*. I didn't know his name. He was large and strong, excessively so. Probably why he was chosen. I saw it happen.

We entered the ruin through the shattered wall of an ancient hallway, what purpose the hallway served, we don't yet know. The northern direction had been fully caved in, so we turned to the south-south-eastern direction. It took perhaps three hours to get to the first archway, moving slowly and carefully, clearing the rubble as we went. The archway itself was large, fully twice the size of one of our standard ones; intricately decorated with a series of pictographs and runes in a language I do not yet understand. It opened into a large domed room, surprisingly mostly intact. Several exits aside from the one we entered were visible, as well as a few pillars which were covered, as the archway, in pictographs and runes. The floor was an intricate picture that once must have been glorious to behold. Now cracked and covered with rock and dust. **Ilareth Dilynrae** was satisfied that this would be a good place to begin the mapping of the ruins. She and **Magus Zauviir** went through the room for over an hour as we waited, finding nothing. We began clearing rubble.

It turns out that not all the dangers here are magical.

The large *mule* was requested to move a particularly large piece of rock. He hefted it with some difficulty. It must have weighed at least four or five of me. It turns out that there was a weight-triggered pressure plate that had been rusted. No other had managed to trigger it. The combined weight must have done it.

Four floor tiles shattered as their mechanisms failed. Two of the four spears did not fail. They were long and thick, matching the relative size of these ruins. I suppose they would be meant to hold, or at least gravely injure a creature perhaps two and a half times the size of their victim. Instead, his head turned fully to mush, and the left half of his body was ripped fully off. I have never seen anything like that. I must write about this. I must get these images down on paper, so that perhaps for but a moment they will leave my mind...

#### 9th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

We've delved deeper and further into the ruins. Perhaps a few thousand feet or so down one of the passages off of the room which has officially been named the Map Room, but I prefer to think of as the Prima Mortis -- the First Death. There are official cartographers of course, but I keep my own maps as well. Perhaps they will have value one day.

This place is intricate, winding. Halls off of halls off of halls are punctuated occasionally by huge rooms, some intact, some filled with rubble. I find myself ignoring the delicate carvings, ornate statues, and impressive craftsmanship to focus more on what the floor beneath me feels like, are there hidden tripwires, holes in the walls for spears or darts.

It turns out there are those among us with keen senses however, and they've quickly been put to work aiding **Ilareth Dilynrae** and the Magus in sweeping rooms and corridors.

Many more traps have been found and disarmed. I'm exhausted from being in a constant state of heightened awareness. One only can speculate on what the morrow may bring.

#### 13th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

My first day of rest since arriving here. **Ilareth Dilynrae** and **Magus Zauviir** have ordered no futher progress while they investigate the last room that we found, but I will get to that.

The last days have been taxing to the extreme. I find myself at the limits of my physical capabilities. Everything aches more than I thought possible; I feel muscles I didn't know I had. More than that is the numbing of intellect. I find myself falling into an intellectual rut, having had no time to engage in anything other than brute physical mindlessness. We haven't even started dusting and catagorizing artifacts. It's just been moving of rubble and rocks, clearing and cleaning, acting as janitors for a long dead city.

We are, at least, making progress.

These people -whoever they were- were surprisingly paranoid. At least it seems that the traps are getting easier to spot which has allowed us to accellerate our trek somewhat.

The first long corridor from Prima Mortis finally came to a dead end - collapsed masonry making it impossible to continue. At least, that's what it appeared to me. The blocked passage is just on the other side of the room which is currently being investigated. Up to that point, the branch tunnels and rooms have been nigh fully explored. We are at least confident that they're not trapped. I don't know why they continue to investigate that final room. It seemed more or less empty. A maybe 20 foot circular dias in the center with nothing on it, at not much else. Oh the usual carvings and runes on the walls, but nothing else.

I will rest my weary limbs now, then find something to amuse myself for the rest of the day.

Addendum: *Eve*

I spent my day wandering the already explored corridors and rooms. It turns out that I have perhaps a keener eye than those who explored these before me.

I've found an artifact of sorts, clearly ancient. It's a small, intricately carved box. There are no jewels or gold adorning it, and it fits in the palm of my hand. The most interesting thing about it however is what must be something of a camoflage built in. This is the reason that I spotted it and none other. A pile of lesser rubble that had been left for later as it was surrounding a cracked pillar sat in one of the offshoot rooms into which I wandered. Among the debris, I spotted a slight discoloration on one of the pieces. Very slight. I retrieved it carefully and now sit alone in my makeshift shelter, away from prying eyes and the other *pack mules* to study my discovery.

It is late, however. I doubt I will glean much before my next day of rest.

#### 14th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

We have returned to work. I will have to wait to study my discovery.

#### 19th Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

Another death. It seems that we are not the only ones to wander these long buried halls. We have of course a group of guards, provided by **Ilareth Dilynrae** and house **Hune**, but it appears that one of their own was not as vigilant as he should have been. Some insectoid creature I'm told. I didn't see it. I just got to clean up afterwards. It took several buckets.

No progress on my discovery. I take it out at night and inspect it, but I haven't yet been able to apply any real brain power to the study of the thing.

#### 21st Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

Four more deaths. They found the nest of those creatures. They were not fully prepared. Without **Magus Zauviir**... well, I doubt I would be making this entry.

The only shadow in this blasted blinding light is that **Magus Zauviir** is completely spent. We have at least a day - perhaps two - of rest ahead of us. I will spend the time well.

#### 22nd Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

Today I study this artifact. Perhaps this is my chance to be recorded eternally in the annuls of history.

Addendum: *Noon*

It's been confirmed we have tomorrow as a rest day as well. This is excellent news. I am making some progress with this artifact, and I believe that with another full day, I may solve this puzzle, for that is what I believe this to be: A puzzle box of sorts. There is no key, nor any obvious way of immediately opening it. Were it magical, the senses of our Magus would certainly have picked up on it. Hopefully it is not just a child's toy that I've found here.

Addendum: *Eve*

More progress. There are (at least) nine latches hidden in exceptionally impressive ways across this device. I've determined how to open two of them, and am beginning to understand the mechanism behind a third. My studies today have at least confirmed that this could be no child's toy, unless the children of the long-dead inhabitants of this place were far more intelligent than us.

#### 23rd Libra, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

And so begins day two...

Addendum: *Noon*

Three further latches. I admit to something of a feeling of unease beginning to interefere with my work. This is incredibly difficult to manipulate, and the latch mechanisms complex to the extreme. I only managed the last latch as I recalled a similar spacial logical puzzle from my days of learning. It was not a puzzle for the uneducated. I hope the contents proove worth this effort.

Addendum: *Eve*

I have seven of nine latches open. This has been an intellectual strain beyond belief. I can wait only until our next day of rest to complete this task.

#### 1st Scorpio, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

The last week has been a blur of sleep and aching muscles. Our expedition has mapped a sizeable section of **Harl'kyorlin**, and we have even discovered a tunnel which could possibly lead to at least one of the other entrances to this labyrinthian ruin. There have been more insectoid attacks, but they are scattered since the nest was destroyed. No further deaths, though a few recieved minor injuries. I have yet to see one of these creatures alive, a fact which I am most grateful for.

We have been given a day of rest tomorrow due to the sheer quantity of work. I will revisit my... other project then.

#### 2nd Scorpio, 1133th Shadowfall

*Mid-morn*

I slept in. Less time to work, but necessary. Fortunately I feel mostly refreshed if sore. Onwards.

Addendum: *Noon*

8/9. The eighth latch was simple. I have no inkling how to open the ninth. With the eighth opening, I was able to glimpse a tiny piece of one of the insides of the box. I may be erroneous, but it appeared to be made of lead. It is possible there is something magical in here after all. My unease has increased, but fortune favours the bold.

Addendum: *Eve*

I have it. I understand the mechanism behind the ninth latch. Why then have I not opened it? Now that I can, I find myself needing some time to consider the potential ramifications. What if the interior is dangerous? Who can tell what's been sitting all these ages behind the shield of lead? I will wait at least until my next day of rest.

#### 5th Scorpio, 1133th Shadowfall

*Eve*

My body, it seems, has finally given out. Through all of this physical labour, I have not said a single word of complaint, not uttered a moan, or even protested against this treatment. The day has finally come where the past near month of strain has caused a weakness to reveal itself.

I was hauling debris as usual, and overestimated my ability to lift. Don't get me wrong, I got the weight into the air, but two steps and my left knee decided it had had enough. Fortunately the rock didn't land on me as it fell, but the joint fully dislocated``

We have healers of course, and they are more than competent, but regardless, I've been put on rest for the next two days. I pride myself that I did not cry out when the injury occured, yet I am certainly appreciative of a chance to... not lift things.

#### 6th Scorpio, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

I have made my choice. Today I rest and meditate. Tomorrow, I open the ninth latch.

#### 7th Scorpio, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

Today I open the artifact. My unease remains, yet I know there is no other option that will satisfy. Onward!

Addendum: *Shortly after Dawn*

I have closed the ninth latch again.

I do not know what it is that I have found. I will describe it here, and what I have gleaned so far.

The ninth latch opened, and the box cracked. It is indeed lined with lead, concealing the contents which are certainly magical. The box contained a small, black crystal shard with green flecks speckled throughout which pulse with a dim light. The shard is smooth on two sides, and jagged on the others, in a vaguely pyramidical shape. Upon touching it, a faint warmth flowed through my finger into my hand. The pulses of green light quickened and appeared to syncronize in timing. Upon lifting the shard, there was a distance, almost unrecognizable tug in my hand; as if the object was pulling me somewhere, deeper into the broken city.

I replaced the object and closed it back in the box, fastening the ninth latch. Now I must consider my next move. Do I turn it in and face the wrath of the higher ups at not immediately revealing it? Perhaps I should pretend to find it, already mostly opened on my next salvage trip.

And yet...

#### 8th Scorpio, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

I have claimed I need a final day of rest before returning to my toils. This claim was accepted without question due to my previous excellent service. I cannot leave this alone, or to others to handle. Today is the day I seek out and solve the mystery of this artifact securing my place in the annuls of history. 

My dreams were the final piece that convinced me of the need.

I dreamt I was floating. A strange ethereal version of myself. I was floating at the entrance to a huge natural cavern. Pillars had been constructed, exceptionally skilled craftsmanship, covered in the same runes and pictographs that we've been seeing our whole time here. Around and about the edges of the cavern were structures which appeared to be broken down marketplace stalls of a scale that fits with the rest of this wreckage. I floated among them, seeing a plethora of archeological treasures which could help build a better understanding of those who once lived here. They appeared to have been abandoned almost immediately and with great haste. I had no time to linger however as I was drawn to the far end of the cavern. A well constructed scaffolding had been created there over a giant hole in the ground which was apparently some form of construction site. I floated nearer and saw a staircase of a grant scale, carved into the ground. A faint pulsing glow came from the depths, matching that of my artifact. A sudden desire filled me to descend, but as I began to, I was awoken by the morning horns.

This cannot have been a coincidence. The artifact wants *me* and me alone to follow its pull.

Addendum: *Eve*

I barely know where to start. What I enscribe here is in truth madness and I would not believe it myself had I not experienced it myself.

I woke taking a further day of rest as noted. Once the camp had emptied, I retrieved the artifact from its case, and snuck out of my tent into the maze of tunnels that is **Harl'kyorli**. The tug took me down a previously unexplored path from Prima Mortis, and I followed with extreme caution, keeping a watchful eye out for others. Fortunately,  **Ilareth Dilynrae** had led most down a different path to continue their exploration, and so I found myself alone in the unknown. I dared not risk a light, so of course all was simple shades of gray. The tunnel wound around and down, a myriad of arches and tunnels breaking off in other directions. I ignored them all as the tug of the crystal pulled me onwards directly down the main path. 

It took perhaps two hours of picking my way across debris, carefully scanning for traps, on the lookout of magical runes before I came to an ornate archway covered in runes. It was surprisingly well preserved which certainly set off warning bells. I spent perhaps 15 minutes or so investigating it. I became certain it was magical, but the tug was ever insistent. In the end, I concluded that it was magically preserved and not trapped, so I went through.

I walked into a vast cavern, the sides of which plunged outwards into the darkness. I couldn't see the roof, nor the walls as they extended past the range of my darksight. Barely visible were two massive columns, pillars that I suddenly recognized as those which I seen in my dreams. The artifact pulled me forward, drew me along between the two pillars. As I held the crystal, the pulsing of the green flecks had syncronized and was becoming more and more rapid. It began giving off a glow which extended outwards perhaps fifty feet around me. It continued to expand as I progressed to the point where I actually feared the glow may extend back far enough to alert someone to my presence. Eventually it extended far enough out to the point where I could see what appeared to be the stalls from my dreams. The scale was consistent with the rest of the ruin, and the pieces that remained lying around could have kept me enthralled for months if not years. At this point though, my path was chosen. I was committed. The pull became stronger and stronger, almost dragging me along the floor.

The scaffolding came into view. The construction site from my dreams. The staircase which I had so desired to explore in my sleep I now had a chance to experience. The descent was not easy. Each stair required some fair effort to climb down and it was not of a short length. As I neared the bottom, I was nearly dragged off my feet by the tug. I was now perhaps a hundred or so feet beneath the cavern, and the construction was becoming spotty, as if it had been abandonned mid-work. There was a tunnel which led outwards from the staircase which was partially supported. It led for maybe thirty feet until it looks like the builders had broken through into another cavern.

I was practically dragged through into the cavern where I saw an amazing sight.

A huge hand of stone, rising out of the ground, palm flat, parallel to the floor, fingers all pointing up at the roof. It was cupping what appeared to be a seven foot tall cluster of crystals, identical in colour and sheen to the one I was holding. It was pulsing green rapidly in time with the piece in my hand. I found myself climbing a rough face of the hand up to the crystal. Immediately I had to fight my hand being dragged right into the large crystal. There was a chip from the crystal, clearly made by a mining tool of some kind, and a hole which matched the size of the piece in my hand.

The struggle was not long.

My hand slammed the piece into the large crystal. It immediately locked in and sealed, leaving no trace there had ever been a piece missing. The pulse that came from the crystal threw me from the hand. A bright green light filled the room, and everything began to fluctuate. The walls shimmered, the hand blurred... and I did too. I blurred, appearing for a brief moment to be two. A bolt of what appeared to be green lightning scithed beside me, and the room snapped back to reality. I turned and looked beside me. I find it hard to describe what next I saw. A crackling green tear in reality perhaps two feet square was there. Through it I saw another. Like me, and yet unlike. I reached for him and the portal snapped closed.

I made my way back to the tent in a daze.

Now I sit here, feeling empty, drained. I feel like something was torn from me, ripped out of my soul. I can barely think. I can barely write, but had to get down my thoughts before I forget a single detail. Now I must sleep.

#### 16th Scorpio, 1133th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

I have slept for the last full week. I was apparently unwakable. Magus **Zauviir** came in this morning and told me that some magical malady had taken me, and that I must continue to rest until further notice. They're searching the current tunnels for a source of it. I know what it is though. Whatever that crystal did to me. I cannot reveal that though.

Though I have been asleep for a week, I have not simply lost the time. I dreamed. I dreamed of many things, but it felt more like I was there, experiencing them myself. Before I describe them though, I must note one other important thing. There is a faint, very faint tug that I feel now. It is only when I concentrate hard that I can feel it, but it is there... and it doesn't pull towards the crystal. I can't tell where it pulls me to, but it pulls.



### Journal: Genie

#### 6th Aries, 1134th Shadowfall

*Dawn*

The latest dream was brutal. I was 





There is no help for it. I cannot any longer ignore the pull or the dreams. I need more information, and I believe I know where I can get it. It will cost me though. All of my pay from the journey to **Harl'kyorli**  combined with my meager savings has netted me a pair of human **ryld**. They are weak and older it seems, but still capable of work. Work will not be my use for them however.

I overheard a rumor in the halls of **Malla Akh'noamuth**, one that was not meant for my ears. **Elkantar Abaeir**, one of the Keepers of Knowledge, was speaking to a scout who I have never met. The scout spoke of having heard from a contact of a **Dao** who came through from the Elemental Plane of Earth, near a deep underground lake that I happen to know well from my wanderings as a youth. Lake **Dobluth** is the name, a place rarely visted as it is the location of a famous betrayal and the outcasting of the one known as **Lightchild**.

I am taking a leave of absence from my duties at  **Malla Akh'noamuth** in order to find this **Dao** and ask of him a way to... repair me.



#### 8th Aries, 1134th Shadowfall

*Noon*

The journey so far has been uneventful. I have treated the **ryld** well, and they are appreciative. Of course, they believe we are going to visit my childhood home. The road is not difficult, and the few **Valsharess'Kyorlin** I have met let me continue with very little questioning. The mark of **Malla Akh'noamuth** holds some sway on these roads.

#### 12th Aries, 1134th Shadowfall

*Eve*

Tomorrow we reach Lake **Dobluth**, or at least the road to it. It is perhaps a day's travel to the shore, and then another half day or so around to where the **Dao** is rumored to be.

#### 15th Aries, 1134th Shadowfall

*Eve*

My life is irrevocably altered.

I sit alone on the banks of Lake **Dobluth**, as the outskirts of a small wood that holds many memories of childhood exploration and imaginative play. I was a master explorer here; discovering ancient civilizations and their treasures, making up stories of their lives based on a rock that looked like a pot or arrowhead. It is, perhaps, appropriate then that this next phase of my life begins.

I met the **Dao**. 

Such a creature I have never seen. I've done my research of course on them, which is perhaps why I live to describe the encounter. I found it taking rest in a cave system near the lake. The crossing from the Element Plane of Earth was perhaps taxing on it, I cannot say. I approached, calling out to it that I wished a parlay, having brought slaves for trade, and showing the utmost respect. That at least got me into its presense alive. I complemented it on its fine jewels and adornments, crying that I had never seen such wonders before. I begged it to listen to my meager request. It was apeased by my manner and complements. It looked over the slaves I had brought, and fortunately deemed them worthy of at least listening to my trade request.

I told my tale of the crystal, of the lightning, the split, and the drained self afterwards. I described my dreams, the sights and deeds I have seen and done while lost to the waking world. I made sure to inform it of where this ruin was and that there were certainly treasures unfound there. This information, as I hoped it would, added greatly to the value of my side of the bargan I seeked to make. The creature, bound by some code of conduct which I cannot fathom, seemed to consider that accepting this information and the slaves put an onus on it to reciprocate. So I asked it simply to make me whole once more.

The **Dao**, it seems, had limited power, and certainly not enough to grant my request. It did, however, agree that my request was a reasonable one in trade. This led to the change I spoke of in my life, and in who I am. I admit, that even with my research and forethought, I could not see next what was coming.

The **Dao** laid a huge rock-hard hand on my head (perhaps it is better to say *engulfed* my head with its hand), and I felt a surge of power. 

How to describe it?

It felt like I was struck inside by a controlled rockslide. Everything went bright white for a moment. My insides churned, I must have cried out as the creature laughed a laugh like gravel sliding down a hill. I felt my mind open to possibilities I had never dreamed of in my wildest ambitions.

Then it removed its hand and moved away, its lower body a swirl of sand as it settled back down. Its words coming slow, and hard.

*I have granted you the potential to fullfill your request. This is our bargin. We are now linked eternally. Depart, mortal.*

I staggered out of the cave half blind. There were screams. Whether they were mine or those of the **ryld** I left with the creature, I cannot say. Perhaps both. My legs took me here unbidden, and I slept. It was at least a day that I knew nothing, not even dreams. Now I am awake, and I am... *different*.

I can feel the power within me. I can shape it through sheer force of will. I can feel there is more there to unlock as I study, and use this power, more will come. I *know* this somehow.

There is one thing more. An anchor to the power within. A small lantern. I cannot remember how I got it, but it sits next to me, and I can feel the connection between my power and this small object.

Understanding dawns as I sit and consider these events. As the **Dao** could not directly grant my request, it has, in a manner, enslaved me while still fulfilling its portion of the bargin. This power though... there is certainly hope now of success. I will rest, then begin my quest to become whole once again.
